  "extended_info": "Since there are no emergency events in your immediate area, it's essential to focus on general preparedness and awareness. Here are some tips to help you prepare for any potential emergency:

**Create an Emergency Kit**: Assemble a kit with essential items such as water, non-perishable food, first aid supplies, flashlights, batteries, and a battery-powered radio. Make sure to check the expiration dates of your supplies and update them as needed. Consider adding a whistle to signal for help if you're trapped.

**Plan an Evacuation Route**: Identify at least two ways out of your neighborhood or building in case you need to evacuate quickly. Designate a meeting spot outside the affected area where family members can gather once they've escaped. Practice your evacuation route with your household to ensure everyone knows what to do.

**Stay Informed**: Sign up for emergency alerts from your local government or weather service to stay informed about potential threats. Keep a battery-powered radio with you in case the power goes out.

**Prepare a Safe Room**: Identify a safe room in your home or building that can provide protection from severe weather or other hazards. This room should be interior, on the lowest floor, and without windows. Stock this room with your emergency kit and any other essential items.

**Make a Communication Plan**: Designate a contact person outside your household in case you get separated. Make sure all household members know the contact person's phone number and email address. Program important phone numbers, such as your emergency contact and utility companies, into your phone.

**Be Prepared for Power Outages**: Keep flashlights, batteries, and a first aid kit on hand in case the power goes out. Consider purchasing a portable generator or installing a whole-house generator to keep your home powered.

Remember, preparedness is key to staying safe during emergencies. While there are no immediate concerns for Golden, CO, it's essential to be proactive and prepared for any potential emergency."
