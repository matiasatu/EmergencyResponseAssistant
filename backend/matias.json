"extended_info": "Based on the current emergency events, it is crucial to take immediate action to ensure your safety. Since there is a fire emergency in Jefferson County, where you are located, prioritize creating an evacuation plan. Identify at least two escape routes from your home, considering the fire's location and wind direction. Make sure to choose routes that are not prone to flooding or other hazards. Designate a meeting point outside the affected area where family members can gather once they have escaped. Practice your evacuation plan with all household members, especially children and seniors, to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency. Additionally, prepare a 72-hour emergency kit with essential items such as water, non-perishable food, first aid supplies, and a battery-powered radio. Stay informed about the fire's progress through local news and emergency alerts. If you are instructed to evacuate, do so immediately. If you are not evacuating, prepare a safe room in your home by closing all windows and doors, turning off air conditioning and ventilation systems, and covering yourself with a damp cloth to protect against smoke inhalation. In case of a power outage, have flashlights and battery-powered lanterns ready. Make makeshift items to help, such as a DIY air purifier using a fan and a HEPA filter, or a homemade fire mask using a cloth and a rubber band. Stay safe and vigilant, and follow all instructions from local authorities."}
