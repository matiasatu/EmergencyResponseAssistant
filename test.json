        "As you are located in Golden, CO, you are not directly affected by the tropical storms in the Virgin Islands or the flooding and severe storms in Alabama and California. However, you should be concerned about the wildfires in Oregon, specifically in Washington, Jefferson, and Deschutes counties. These fires are relatively close to your location, and it's essential to take precautions to ensure your safety.
    
        First, create a wildfire evacuation plan with your household members. Identify at least two escape routes from your home and neighborhood, considering the direction of the wind and the location of the fires. Make sure to include a meeting point outside the affected area where everyone can gather once they've evacuated. Practice your plan with all household members, especially children and seniors, to ensure everyone knows what to do in case of an emergency.
    
        Prepare a wildfire emergency kit with essential items such as N95 masks, goggles, a first aid kit, a battery-powered radio, and a charged cell phone. Keep your car's gas tank full and make sure your vehicle is in good working condition. If you have pets, prepare a pet emergency kit with food, water, and any necessary medication.
    
        Stay informed about the fire's progression and any evacuation orders through local news, emergency alerts, and social media. Sign up for emergency alerts from your local authorities to receive timely updates. Keep your phone charged and with you at all times.
    
        If you're advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Wear protective clothing, including long-sleeved shirts, long pants, and closed-toe shoes. Bring your emergency kit and any essential items, such as medication, important documents, and irreplaceable belongings. Avoid driving through heavy smoke or flames, and keep your headlights on to increase visibility.
    
        If you're unable to evacuate, prepare a safe room in your home by closing all windows and doors, covering vents, and turning off air conditioning and heating systems. Stay away from windows and exterior walls, and seek shelter in an interior room or hallway. Use a wet cloth to cover your nose and mouth to protect yourself from smoke inhalation.
    
        Remember to prioritize your safety and the safety of those around you. Stay vigilant, and take all necessary precautions to protect yourself from the wildfires in Oregon."
